                        STEM is an important asset for schools because it exposes students to career
                        opportunities in the many fields that apply Math, Science, Technology, and
                        Engineering. Providing students with a higher level of education before they reach
                        college level courses allows them to hone their skills and gives them avenues to
                        pursue realized passions for different subjects.

                            I teach Pre-AP Physics, AP Physics 2, AP Physics C: Mechanics, and AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism. AP Physics C is the highest level physics course available at Hebron High School; routine use of calculus to solve problems is the hallmark of this course.

                            Everything in the world is STEM. Not just engineering, but also banking, driving, business, cooking, painting, singing, sports, armed forces, builders, designers, and just about anything else in life uses concepts and skills learned in STEM courses. To be safe and successful, one must use information from various STEM areas all the time.
                            
                            We don't exist without STEM.

                            “Computer science embraces problem solving, hardware, algorithms, and perspectives that help people utilize computers to address real-world problems in contemporary life.”

                            “The..course introduces students to computer science with fundamental topics that include problem solving, design strategies and methodologies, organization of data (data structures), approaches to processing data (algorithms), analysis of potential solutions and the ethical and social implications of computing. The course emphasizes both object-oriented and imperative problem solving and design.”
                            
                            STEM is critical because the number of STEM jobs in the United Sates will grow by 14% from 2010 to 2020, according to the US Deparment of Education. This is a much greater rate that the national average of 5-8% across all other job sectors.

                                STEM is necessary for the general well being and economy of our world. In order to meet high demand for contributing and fulfilling STEM careers, it’s very important that students explore and pursue STEM courses from an early age.
                                The course I taught was engineering and design and in that class students take part in general construction of items. A general overview of engineering as a career path is also given. Oftentimes the students present their work to the class.
                                
                                Involved in many engineering ventures that students can partake. Assignments are given and are shared with the class or, on most occasions, just shared with the teacher. Give students the opportunity to blossom interest in engineering as a career path.

                                    I teach Pre-AP Algebra II and Precalculus. Algebra II teaches students about various functions and how to solve equations involving those functions. Students also learn how to apply functions and their properties and graphs to real-life situations. Precalculus prepares students to take Calculus by providing an advanced study of algebra and an introduction to trigonometry, trigonometric functions, and trigonometric identities. I believe that STEM is important because the world is growing increasingly more connected through technology and careers in STEM fields are necessary to maintain that growth and innovation.

                                            I feel STEM classes are extremely important as ALL students need to have a basic understanding of the world around them and the basics laws governing nature. This makes them more educated, productive citizens and smarter consumers. Also STEM classes utilize learning from other content areas such as English, Mathematics, and History. STEM classes tend to put into practice learning from the other core areas so that students see the practical application of material they learned elsewhere.
