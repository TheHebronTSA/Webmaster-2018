          <p>Hebron’s TSA Chapter was established in 1999, the same year the high school opened. With just 8 members at its launch, the team has grown tremendously in size as it presently has over 100 members, only looking to expand its reach and influence throughout the school. According to Scot Finch, the principal of Hebron High School, the reason for bringing TSA to Hebron at its opening was the need for an extracurricular club that encouraged the development of STEM-based classes, promoted leadership development, and included competitive opportunities for students. In the past, Engineering and Architectural Design instructor, Dale Rodgers, was the advisor and sponsor of Hebron TSA; however, he has recently left the school, leaving many of the responsibilities of running the chapter in the hands of the students. Hebron TSA hopes to continue to flourish this competitive season despite Mr. Rodger’s departure.</p>
