The rules were (1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm, (2) A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law, (3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.</p>

The proposal for the conference included this assertion: "every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it."</p>

Samuel's machine learning programs were responsible for the high performance of the checkers player. He believed teaching computers to play games was very fruitful for developing tactics appropriate to general problems, and he chose checkers as it is relatively simple though has a depth of strategy.</p>

Shakey was developed at the Artificial Intelligence Center of Stanford Research Institute (now called SRI International).</p>
